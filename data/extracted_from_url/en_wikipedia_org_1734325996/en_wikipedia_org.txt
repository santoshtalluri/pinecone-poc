He is often considered one of the greatest, most accomplished and commercially successful actors in the history of Indian cinema . [ 8 ] With a cinematic career spanning over five decades, he has played pivotal roles in over 200 films . Bachchan is often hailed as the Shahenshah of Bollywood , Sadi Ke Mahanayak (translated as "Greatest actor of the century" in Hindi), Star of the Millennium, or simply Big B. [ 9 ] His dominance in the Indian film industry during the 1970s–80s led the French director François Truffaut to describe it as a "one-man industry". [ 10 ] He is a recipient of several accolades including six National Film Awards and sixteen Filmfare Awards . Amitabh Bachchan was born in 1942 in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to the Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and his wife, the social activist Teji Bachchan . He was educated at Sherwood College , Nainital , and Kirori Mal College , University of Delhi . His film career started in 1969 as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen 's film Bhuvan Shome . He first gained popularity in the early-1970s for films, such as Anand , Zanjeer and Roti Kapada Aur Makaan , and achieved greater stardom in later years, being dubbed India's "Angry Young Man" for several of his on-screen roles in Hindi films. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] He consistently starred in top–grossing Indian films from the mid-1970s to the 1980s, such as Deewaar , Sholay , Kabhi Kabhie , Hera Pheri , Amar Akbar Anthony , Parvarish , Kasme Vaade , Don , Trishul , Muqaddar Ka Sikandar , Suhaag , Dostana , Naseeb , Laawaris , Namak Halaal , Andhaa Kaanoon , Coolie , Sharaabi and Mard , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] as well as some of his most acclaimed performances, include Namak Haraam , Abhimaan , Majboor , Mili , Chupke Chupke , Do Anjaane , Kaala Patthar , Shaan , Silsila , Yaarana , Kaalia , Shakti , Aakhree Raasta , Shahenshah and Agneepath . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] After taking a break from acting in the 1990s, his resurgence was marked in 2000 with Mohabbatein . [ 17 ] Since then he starred in several successful and acclaimed films like Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham , Aankhen , Baghban , Khakee , Black , Bunty Aur Babli , Sarkar , Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna , Bhoothnath , Cheeni Kum , Paa , Piku , Pink , Badla , Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Kalki 2898 AD . [ 18 ] For Piku , he won his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor , making him the only actor to do so. Bachchan also made an appearance in a Hollywood film, The Great Gatsby (2013), in which he played a non-Indian Jewish character. [ 19 ] Bachchan has won numerous accolades in his career, including record four National Film Awards in Best Actor category and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies. He has won sixteen Filmfare Awards and is the most nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare with 34 nominations in Best Actor and 42 nominations overall. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001, the Padma Vibhushan in 2015, and India's highest award in the field of cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2018 for his contributions to the arts . The Government of France honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Officer of the Legion of Honour , in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond. In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer, and television presenter. He has hosted several seasons of the game show Kaun Banega Crorepati , India's version of the game show franchise, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . He also entered politics for a time in the 1980s. Bachchan has also been involved in several humanitarian works and he is a leading brand endorser in India. Beyond the Indian subcontinent , he acquired a large overseas following of the South Asian diaspora , as well as others, in markets including Africa (South Africa, Eastern Africa, and Mauritius ), the Middle East (especially Egypt and the UAE ), the United Kingdom, Russia, Central Asia, the Caribbean ( Guyana , Suriname , and Trinidad and Tobago ), Oceania ( Fiji , Australia, and New Zealand), Canada and the United States. [ 20 ] Bachchan was voted the "greatest star of stage or screen" in the BBC Your Millennium online poll in 1999. [ 21 ] In October 2003, Time magazine dubbed Bachchan the "Star of the Millennium". [ 22 ] Early life and family Further information: Bachchan family Bachchan was born on 11 October 1942 in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and social activist Teji Bachchan . [ 23 ] Harivansh Rai Bachchan was an Awadhi Hindu Kayastha , [ 24 ] who was fluent in Awadhi , [ 25 ] Hindi and Urdu . [ 26 ] Harivansh's ancestors came from a village called Babupatti , in the Raniganj tehsil, in the Pratapgarh district , in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh , in India. [ 27 ] Teji Bachchan was a Punjabi Sikh Khatri from Lyallpur , Punjab , British India (present-day Faisalabad , Punjab , Pakistan). [ 25 ] [ 28 ] Bachchan has a younger brother, Ajitabh, who is five years younger than him. [ 29 ] Bachchan's parents were initially going to name him Inquilaab ( Hindustani for "Revolution"), inspired by the phrase Inquilab Zindabad ("Long live the revolution") popularly used during the Indian independence struggle; the name Amitabh was suggested to his father by poet Sumitranandan Pant . [ 30 ] [ 1 ] Although his surname was Srivastava , Amitabh's father, who opposed the caste system , had adopted the pen name Bachchan ("child-like" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works. [ 31 ] When his father was looking to get him admitted to a school, he and Bachchan's mother decided the family's name should be Bachchan instead of Shrivastava. [ 32 ] It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and used for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family. [ 33 ] Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007. [ 34 ] Bachchan's secondary education was at Boys' High School & College in Allahabad and Sherwood College in Nainital . He attended Kirori Mal College at the University of Delhi in Delhi. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Kirori Mal College in 1962. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] When Bachchan finished his studies, his father approached Prithviraj Kapoor , the founder of Prithvi Theatre and patriarch of the Kapoor acting family , to see if there was an opening for him, but Kapoor offered no encouragement. [ 40 ] Bachchan was a friend of Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi , before he became an actor. He used to spend time with them when he was a resident in New Delhi. Bachchan's family were very close to the Nehru-Gandhi family of politicians. When Sonia Gandhi first came to India from Italy before her marriage, Bachchan had received her at the Palam International Airport on 13 January 1968. She spent 48 days at Bachchan's house with his parents before her wedding to Rajiv. [ 41 ] In the late 1960s, Bachchan applied to be a newsreader for All India Radio in Delhi, but "failed the audition". [ 40 ] [ 42 ] He became a business executive for Bird & Company in Kolkata (Calcutta), [ 40 ] [ when? ] and worked in theatre before starting his film career. [ 43 ] It is thought that his mother might have had some influence on his choice of career, for she always insisted that he should "take centre stage". [ 44 ] [ according to whom? ] Acting career Further information: Amitabh Bachchan filmography Early career (1969–1972) Bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen 's National Award –winning film Bhuvan Shome . [ 45 ] His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat Hindustani , [ 46 ] directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt , Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood ), Madhu and Jalal Agha . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Anand (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna . His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor . He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwana (1971). Following Parwana were several films, including Reshma Aur Shera (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri . He narrated part of the film Bawarchi . [ 49 ] In 1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa directed by S. Ramanathan which was moderately successful. [ 50 ] Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well. [ 51 ] His only film with Mala Sinha , Sanjog (1972) was also a box office failure. [ 52 ] Rise to prominence (1973–1974) Bachchan was struggling, seen as a "failed newcomer" who, by the age of 30, had twelve commercial failures and only two successes (as a lead in Bombay to Goa and a supporting role in Anand ). [ citation needed ] He was offered to play dual roles by director O. P. Goyle and writer O. P. Ralhan for the film Bandhe Haath in 1973. This was the first movie in which Bachchan played a double role. [ 53 ] Bachchan was then discovered by screenwriter duo Salim–Javed , consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar . [ 54 ] Salim Khan wrote the story, screenplay and script of Zanjeer (1973), and conceived the "angry young man" persona of the lead role. Javed Akhtar came on board as co-writer, [ 55 ] and Prakash Mehra , who saw the script as potentially groundbreaking, as the film's director. However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead "angry young man" role; it was turned down by several actors, owing to it going against the "romantic hero" image dominant in the industry at the time. [ 54 ] Salim-Javed "saw his talent, which most makers didn't. He was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren't good." [ 56 ] According to Salim Khan, they "strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for Zanjeer ". [ 54 ] Salim Khan introduced Bachchan to Prakash Mehra, [ 55 ] and Salim-Javed insisted that Bachchan be cast for the role. [ 54 ] Zanjeer was a crime film with violent action, [ 54 ] in sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it, and it established Amitabh in a new persona—the "angry young man" of Bollywood. [ 57 ] He earned his first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor , with Filmfare later considering this one of the most iconic performances in Bollywood history. [ 51 ] The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star. [ 58 ] It was the first of many collaborations between Salim-Javed and Amitabh; the duo wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as Deewaar (1975) and Sholay (1975). [ 56 ] Salim Khan also introduced Bachchan to director Manmohan Desai with whom he formed a long and successful association, alongside Prakash Mehra and Yash Chopra . [ 55 ] Eventually, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. His portrayal of the wronged hero fighting a crooked system and circumstances of deprivation in films like Zanjeer , Deewaar , Trishul , Kaala Patthar and Shakti resonated with the masses of the time, especially the youth who harboured a simmering discontent owing to social ills such as poverty, hunger , unemployment, corruption, social inequality and the brutal excesses of The Emergency . This led to Bachchan being dubbed as the "angry young man", a journalistic catchphrase that became a metaphor for the dormant rage, frustration, restlessness, sense of rebellion and anti-establishment disposition of an entire generation, prevalent in 1970s India. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together: not only Zanjeer but also subsequent films such as Abhimaan , which was released only a month after their wedding and was also successful at the box office. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna , in the film Namak Haraam , a social drama directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. [ 62 ] His supporting role won him his second Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor . [ 63 ] The flow of successes continued for Bachchan in 1974. [ 64 ] He began the year with a guest appearance in Dulal Guha 's blockbuster social drama film Dost . [ 65 ] After this, he starred in Aravind Sen's drama film Kasauti and Narendra Bedi 's crime thriller Benaam , both of which ended up as moderate commercial successes. Bachchan's next release was Manoj Kumar 's fourth directional venture Roti Kapada Aur Makaan . [ 66 ] The film opened to excellent response all over the country, eventually taking top spot at the box office that year and emerging an All Time Blockbuster as well as Bachchan's biggest hit at that point of time. [ 67 ] Before the end of year, he delivered a hit in Ravi Tandon 's crime thriller Majboor . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Written by Salim-Javed, it also had Pran and Parveen Babi in the lead. [ 70 ] Superstardom (1975–1988) In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres, from the comedy Chupke Chupke and the crime drama Faraar to the romantic drama Mili . [ 71 ] This was also the year in which Bachchan starred in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history, both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting Bachchan. [ 56 ] The first was Deewaar , directed by Yash Chopra, where he worked with Shashi Kapoor , Nirupa Roy , Parveen Babi , and Neetu Singh . The film emerged a blockbuster at the box office and earned him another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. [ 72 ] Indiatimes ranks Deewaar among the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films . [ 73 ] The other, released on 15 August 1975, was Sholay , which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at the time, [ 74 ] in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. Deewaar and Sholay are often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with Zanjeer , and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s and 1980s. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] In 1999, BBC India declared Sholay the "Film of the Millennium" and, like Deewaar , it has been cited by Indiatimes Movies as among the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films . [ 73 ] In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years. Bachchan and Dharmendra starrer Sholay (1975) recorded an estimated ₹ 15-18 crore footfalls, making it the highest grossing Indian film in terms of audience attendance to date. [ 77 ] In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic musical Kabhi Kabhie . [ 78 ] Bachchan starred as a young poet, Amit Malhotra, who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja ( Rakhee Gulzar ) who ends up marrying someone else ( Shashi Kapoor ). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his "angry young man" roles like Zanjeer and Deewaar . Despite its heavy theme, Kabhi Kabhie went on to become a superhit. [ 79 ] Its soundtrack composed by Khayyam and lyrics written by Sahir Ludhianvi dominated the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala and was one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s. [ 80 ] Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year, he played a double role in another hit Adalat as father and son. In 1977, he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Amar Akbar Anthony , in which he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other major hits that year include Parvarish and Khoon Pasina . [ 81 ] He once again resumed double roles in films such as Kasme Vaade (1978) as Amit and Shankar and Don (1978) playing the characters of Don , a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's Trishul and Prakash Mehra's Muqaddar Ka Sikandar both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. 1978 is arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases in the same year, namely Muqaddar Ka Sikandar , Trishul , Don , Kasme Vaade , Ganga Ki Saugandh and Besharam were box office successes, with the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, a rare feat in Hindi cinema. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] In 1979, Bachchan starred in Suhaag which was the highest-earning film of that year. [ 84 ] In the same year, he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like Jurmana , Mr. Natwarlal and Kaala Patthar . [ 85 ] He was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film Mr. Natwarlal in which he starred with Rekha . Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Award for Best Actor and the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer . He also received a Best Actor nomination for Kaala Patthar and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed superhit film Dostana , in which he starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman . [ 86 ] In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film Silsila , where he starred alongside his wife Jaya Bachchan and also Rekha. [ 87 ] Other successful films of this period include Ram Balram (1980), Shaan (1980), Naseeb (1981), Lawaaris (1981), Kaalia (1981), Yaarana (1981), Barsaat Ki Ek Raat (1981) and Shakti (1982), also starring Dilip Kumar . [ 88 ] [ 89 ] In 1982, he played double roles in the musical Satte Pe Satta and action drama Desh Premee which succeeded at the box office along with highly successful ventures like action comedy Namak Halaal , action drama Khud-Daar and the critically acclaimed drama Bemisal . [ 90 ] On 26 July 1982, while filming a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar for Coolie , Bachchan had a near-fatal intestinal injury. [ 91 ] Bachchan was performing his stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in the hospital for many months, at times close to death. There were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating; the public response included prayers in places of worship and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him. [ 92 ] Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The director, Manmohan Desai , altered the ending of Coolie : Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off; but, after the change of script, the character lived in the end. Desai felt it would have been inappropriate for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. The footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking it as the instant of the actor's injury. [ 93 ] The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, it emerged an All Time Blockbuster and top-grossing film of the year. [ 94 ] He then played a triple role in S. Ramanathan 's action drama Mahaan , which proved to be a flop. [ 95 ] Other releases that year, Nastik and Pukar were average fares, but Andhaa Kaanoon (in which he had a small role) was a blockbuster. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] During a stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, five of his completed films were released, out of which, Manmohan Desai 's action film Mard (1985) went on to become a massive blockbuster, followed by superhits, Sharaabi (1984) and Geraftaar (1985), a hit film, Aakhree Raasta (1986) and a moderate success in Inquilaab (1984) to go with the major commercial successes. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] After a three-year stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, Bachchan returned to films in 1988, playing the title role in Tinnu Anand 's vigilante action film Shahenshah , which opened to bumper response all over the nation and emerged a huge hit as well as the second highest-grossing film of the year . [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Health issues He was later diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis . The illness weakened him both mentally and physically. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, "Yeh film to flop hogi!" ("This film will flop"). [ 101 ] He then decided to quit films and ventured into politics. Career fluctuations, sabbatical, business ventures and acting comeback (1989–1999) After the success of his comeback film however, Bachchan's star power began to wane as his subsequent releases like Gangaa Jamunaa Saraswati , Jaadugar , Toofan and Main Azaad Hoon (all released in 1989) did not do well commercially. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] He gained success during this period with superhits in K.C. Bokadia 's crime drama film Aaj Ka Arjun (1990) and Mukul Anand 's masala film Hum (1991), but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Notably, despite a decline in number of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the cult film Agneepath (1990). [ 107 ] He turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up Amitabh Bachchan Corporation , Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996. ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry. ABCL's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management. [ 108 ] Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was Tere Mere Sapne , which was a box office hit [ 109 ] and launched the careers of actors like Arshad Warsi and southern film star Simran . [ 110 ] In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film Mrityudata , produced by ABCL. Though Mrityudaata attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically. [ 111 ] ABCL was the main sponsor of the 1996 Miss World beauty pageant , Bangalore , but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top-level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the Indian Industries board. The Bombay High Court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay bungalow 'Prateeksha' and two flats until the pending loan recovery cases of Canara Bank were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company. [ 114 ] Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career, and eventually had commercial success with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998) and Major Saab (1998), and received positive reviews for Sooryavansham (1999), but other films such as Lal Baadshah (1999) and Kohram (1999) were box office failures. [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Return to success (2000–present) In 2000, Bachchan appeared in Aditya Chopra 's romantic blockbuster Mohabbatein . [ 119 ] He played a stern, elder figure who rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan . [ 120 ] His role won him his third Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor . [ 121 ] Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in Aks (2001), Aankhen (2002), Kaante (2002), Khakee (2004), Dev (2004) and Veer-Zaara (2004). His performance in Aks won him his first Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor . [ 122 ] One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's Black (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an ageing teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award, and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the films Bunty Aur Babli (2005), the Godfather adaptation Sarkar (2005), and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). All of them were successful at the box office. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ] His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were Baabul (2006), [ 126 ] Ekalavya (2007) and Nishabd (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics. [ 127 ] In May 2007, two of his films, the romantic comedy Cheeni Kum and the multi-starrer action drama Shootout at Lokhandwala , were released. Shootout at Lokhandwala did well at the box office and was declared a hit in India, while Cheeni Kum picked up after a slow start and was declared a semi-hit by the end of its theatrical run. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ] [ 131 ] A remake of his biggest hit, Sholay (1975), entitled Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag , released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception. [ 131 ] The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film, Rituparno Ghosh 's The Last Lear , co-starring Arjun Rampal and Preity Zinta . The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best since Black .

[ 134 ] Amitabh Bachchan and Yash Chopra in the premiere of Paa . Bachchan received his third National Film Award for Best Actor at the 57th National Film Awards for his performance and his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Paa. Vivek Sharma 's Bhoothnath , in which he plays the title role as a ghost, was released on 9 May 2008. Sarkar Raj , the sequel of the 2005 film Sarkar , released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box office. Paa , which was released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria -affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's performance and was one of the top-grossing films of 2009. [ 135 ] It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award. In 2010, he debuted in Malayalam film through Kandahar , directed by Major Ravi and co-starring Mohanlal . [ 136 ] The film was based on the hijacking incident of the Indian Airlines Flight 814 . [ 137 ] Bachchan declined any remuneration for this film. [ 138 ] In 2011 he played an aged retired former gangster in Bbuddah... Hoga Terra Baap who protects his son Sonu Sood who is an honest daring police officer from a notorious gangster Prakash Raj who unknowingly hired the latter to perform a contract killing not knowing that the police officer is the gangster's son. [ 139 ] Despite significant expectations, it had poor returns at the box office. [ 140 ] Bachchan with Mohanlal In 2013, he made his Hollywood debut in The Great Gatsby making a special appearance opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire . [ 141 ] In 2014, he played the role of the friendly ghost in the sequel Bhoothnath Returns . The next year, he played the role of a grumpy father experiencing chronic constipation in the critically acclaimed Piku which was also one of the biggest hits of 2015. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] A review in Daily News and Analysis (DNA) summarised Bachchan's performance as "The heart and soul of Piku clearly belong to Amitabh Bachchan who is in his elements. His performance in Piku, without doubt, finds a place among the top 10 in his illustrious career." [ 145 ] Rachel Saltz wrote for The New York Times , "Piku", an offbeat Hindi comedy, would have you contemplate the intestines and mortality of one Bhashkor Banerji and the actor who plays him, Amitabh Bachchan. Bhashkor's life and conversation may revolve around his constipation and fussy hypochondria, but there's no mistaking the scene-stealing energy that Mr. Bachchan, India's erstwhile Angry Young Man, musters for his new role of Cranky Old Man." [ 146 ] Well known Indian critic Rajeev Masand wrote on his website, "Bachchan is pretty terrific as Bhashkor, who reminds you of that oddball uncle that you nevertheless have a soft spot for. He bickers with the maids, harrows his hapless helper, and expects Piku to stay unmarried so she can attend to him. At one point, to ward off a possible suitor, he casually mentions that his daughter isn't a virgin; that she's financially independent and sexually independent too. Bachchan embraces the character's many idiosyncrasies , never once slipping into caricature while all along delivering big laughs thanks to his spot-on comic timing." [ 147 ] The Guardian summed up, "Bachchan seizes upon his cranky character part, making Bashkor as garrulously funny in his theories on caste and marriage as his system is backed-up." [ 148 ] The performance won Bachchan his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Bachchan with Vijay In 2016, he appeared in the women-centric courtroom drama film Pink which was highly praised by critics and with an increasingly good word of mouth, was a resounding success at the domestic and overseas box office. [ 149 ] [ 150 ] [ 151 ] [ 152 ] Bachchan's performance in the film received acclaim. According to Raja Sen of Rediff.com, "Amitabh Bachchan, a retired lawyer with bipolar disorder, takes up cudgels on behalf of the girls, delivering courtroom blows with pugilistic grace. As we know from Prakash Mehra movies, in each life some Bachchan must fall. The girls hang on to him with incredulous desperation, and he bats for them with all he has. At one point Meenal hangs by Bachchan's elbow, words entirely unnecessary. Bachchan towers through Pink – the way he bellows "et cetera" is alone worth having the heavy-hitter at play—but there are softer moments like one where he appears to have dozed off in court, or where he lays his head by his convalescent wife's bedside and needs his hair ruffled and his conviction validated." [ 153 ] Writing for Hindustan Times , noted film critic and author Anupama Chopra said of Bachchan's performance, "A special salute to Amitabh Bachchan, who imbues his character with a tragic majesty. Bachchan towers in every sense, but without a hint of showboating. [ 150 ] Meena Iyer of The Times of India wrote, "The performances are pitch-perfect with Bachchan leading the way. [ 154 ] Writing for NDTV , Troy Ribeiro of Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) stated, "Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgall, the aged defence lawyer, shines as always, in a restrained, but powerful performance. His histrionics come primarily in the form of his well-modulated baritone, conveying his emotions and of course, from the well-written lines." [ 155 ] Mike McCahill of The Guardian remarked, "Among an electric ensemble, Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang give unwavering voice to the girls' struggles; Amitabh Bachchan brings his moral authority to bear as their sole legal ally. [ 156 ] In 2017, he appeared in the third instalment of the Sarkar film series: Ram Gopal Varma 's Sarkar 3 . That year, he started filming for the swashbuckling action-adventure film Thugs of Hindostan with Aamir Khan , Katrina Kaif and Fatima Sana Shaikh which released in November 2018. [ 157 ] He co-starred with Rishi Kapoor in 102 Not Out , a comedy drama film directed by Umesh Shukla based on a Gujarati play of the same name written by Saumya Joshi .

[ 162 ] The following year, he co-starred alongside Ayushmann Khurana in Shoojit Sircar 's comedy drama Gulabo Sitabo , which won him Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics) . [ 163 ] He then collaborated with Emraan Hashmi for Chehre (2021), a critical and commercial failure.

[ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ] In 2024, he played Ashwatthama in Nag Ashwin 's Kalki 2898 AD , marking his Telugu debut.

But the company fell into debt with a fiasco and went into bankruptcy, subsequently Bachchan became nearly bankrupt.
