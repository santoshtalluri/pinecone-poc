Your tech stack has been updated and noted. Here's a quick breakdown of how this setup will come together and key points to focus on.

	•	RAG: LangChain
	•	Vector Store: Pinecone
	•	Data Modeling: MongoDB
	•	LLMs: Configurable (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
	•	Conversational AI: Rasa
	•	Embeddings: FastText
	•	Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes


1️⃣ RAG Creation - LangChain
Why: LangChain provides modular support for RAG pipelines and makes it easy to integrate with LLMs, vector stores, and document loaders.
Action:
Use LangChain's Document Loaders to load data (PDFs, CSVs, URLs) into RAGs.
Use Chains to create a document retriever with Pinecone.
Use LLMChain to link your LLM (like GPT-4) to the retrieved documents.


2️⃣ Vector Storage - Pinecone
Why: Pinecone provides a fully managed, scalable, and low-latency vector store.
Action:
Store vector embeddings for every document or text you extract via LangChain.
Ensure the metadata (like source name, path) is uploaded so you can retrieve context during queries.
Important: Use index.upsert() to insert vectors with metadata.


3️⃣ Data Modeling - MongoDB
Why: MongoDB allows for flexible data models and supports storing JSON-like documents.
Action:
Use MongoDB to store metadata related to RAGs, such as:
RAG Details (creation date, files used, embeddings used, etc.)
LLM Configuration (track LLMs used to create the RAG).
Conversation Logs (track Rasa conversations for feedback loops).
Use Mongoose (Node.js) or PyMongo (Python) for integration.


4️⃣ LLM Flexibility (GPT-4 and Beyond)
Why: You want to switch between LLMs via configuration.
Action:
Create a config.yaml or .env file with LLM parameters (like model name, API key, and provider).
Load LLM dynamically via LangChain's LLM abstraction.
Sample LLM config in .env:
env
Copy code
LLM_PROVIDER=openai  # openai, huggingface, cohere
LLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key


5️⃣ Conversational AI - Rasa
Why: Rasa is a fully open-source conversational AI framework with support for intents, NLU, and RAG workflows.
Action:
Connect Rasa to the LLM pipeline to respond to user queries.
Rasa can call your RAG system via REST API.
When Rasa receives a query, it calls the RAG /ask endpoint to retrieve knowledge.


6️⃣ Embedding Model - FastText
Why: FastText provides lightweight, fast embeddings.
Action:
Use FastText to embed text into vectors.
These embeddings will be stored in Pinecone.
Replace OpenAIEmbeddings in LangChain with a custom embedding model using FastText.
Example of embedding using FastText:
python
Copy code
import fasttext.util

fasttext.util.download_model('en', if_exists='ignore')  # Download the model
ft = fasttext.load_model('cc.en.300.bin')

def embed_text(text):
    return ft.get_sentence_vector(text)  # Embed the text

    
7️⃣ Deployment - Docker + Kubernetes (K8s)
Why: For scalability and reliability, you'll containerize the app with Docker and orchestrate it with K8s.
Action:
Create a Dockerfile to containerize the app.
Use Docker Compose for local testing.
Deploy to Kubernetes using a k8s deployment YAML.
Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps to load API keys into pods.
